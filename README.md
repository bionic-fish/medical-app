<h2>Medical App Overview</h2>

This is a personal project dedicated to my younger sister who was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. I am envisioning an application pair to a 
smart phone or smart watch device that can monitor blood glucose levels in real time without the need for invasive procedures.

<h4>Scope</h4>
Develop an application to provide the user with a real time reading and monitorization of their blood glucose level.
[Type 2 Diabetes]

<h4>App Overview</h4>
A personal project that will require research into technologies and features of JavaScript I am unfamiliar with at this current time. This
will be a work-in-progress project until I am able to produce a working prototype with what I am invisioning.

The predictions for the Application are as follows:
Provide a friendly UI to help with the approachability aspect of the application.
Provide a comfortable and non-invasive way to monitor blood glucose levels in real time.
Create Personal Database to store emails for newletter

<h4>App Requirements</h4>
Provide a non invasive way to view relevant diabetic information.<br>
Pair application with diabetic pump via bluetooth.<br>
Provide blood glucose levels in real time.<br>
Alert when levels are exceeding over optimal limit.<br>
Alert when levels are decressing under optimal limit.<br>
Alert + Vibrate when device has < 1hour battery life.<br>
